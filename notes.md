## Qingyuan Wu's Website

This will be my personal website. I'll leave any notes here.

Started 9:30am Dec 26, 2021.

Completed and uploaded a usable version to http://qingyuanwu.com on 1:45pm Jan 4, 2022

### Issues
* Why is there a scroll bar for the Projects section?
* Why is the Design projects columns not floating left?

FIXED ABOVE

### Jan 1, 2022 Next Steps
* Try to get all buttons to align (not priority)
* Make the "languages used" thing a list?
* Different sections of website should have diff colours
* Perhaps responsive table for mobile view?
* Actually recording the demos/provide links/documentation of projects

### Jan 2
* potentially need to fix table font color issue
* Find a pretty font
* Fix project margins issue
* BUtton (arrows) to go to the next section

### Jan 4 3pm
* Changed index.html - columns section
* Changed CSS folder - columns.css and styles.css

### Logos
To make the logo, I went on Canvas (although Word/Publisher is probably better looking back now). I saved the picture and pasted onto Word. Here, I made the image *transparent*.

I used a 32x32 pixel version of the image for the Chrome tab icon, as well as a 64x64 version for the Navbar logo. They're both saved in images/logo/

To size the image down to 32/64 pixels, I used an online resizing [tool](https://resizeimage.net/). You can also crop image here. Just start by stating some coordinates and you can drag around.

### Website Hosting/Domain
* Domain is free for this year (until Jan 4, 2023). Next year it'll be $2.17 per month.
* Economy Linux Hosting with cPanel is $12 per month starting next year, I think it's $2.17/month this year??

* **TOTAL COST**
  * 2022: $2.17/month (although I paid for the entire year already)
  * 2023 onwards: $11.99+$2.17 = $14.16/month


### Jan 5 5:30pm
To access cPanel, go to Go Daddy -> My Products -> Web Hosting -> Manage. Website updates instantaneously. It seems like to upload folders you have to first zip it :/

### Jan 10 3:30pm
Added some translation properties for the projects section, also changed default colour. CHanges in `columns.css`.
